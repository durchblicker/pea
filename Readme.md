# Pea

**Pea** is basically a simple promise-like library. It's very light weight (less than 300 lines of code) and simple.

Contrary to a lot of the other promise libraries it doesn't run roughshod over the NodeJS conventions for callbacks, but works with them. At the same time it helps a bit with callback hell and makes for a much nicer code-style.

Of course this also ensures that it does not follow any ideas you might have on promises. While some may think that's a bad thing, I think that's actually good.

**Pea** let's you have the good parts of promises without all the garbage.

In concept it is very similar to *async*, but it's simpler and much cleaner to work with.

## Installation / Use

For Node-JS

    npm install pea

In Browser

    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://raw.github.com/phidelta/pea/master/pea.js"></script>

## API

### Pea(fn, [arg], […])

**Arguments**

 * *fn* a node-style function whose last argument is a callback that needs to be called upon completion
 * *arg* the arguments that *fn* is called with

The constructor of a *Pea-Instance*. This executes *fn* with *arg*s. It returns a *Pea-Instance*. The *fn* function needs to call the callback, passed as the last argument appended to *args*, when it is complete. So basically *fn* can be any node-style function that follows the `callback as the last argument` convention.

#### pea.then(cb)

**Arguments**

 * *cb* a node style callback function whose first argument is an error or null if successful

This registers a callback to execute when the *Pea-Instance* is complete. Then can be called as often as necessary. Even after the *Pea-Instance* is complete. It will always call *cb* with the arguments passed to the callback by the main function.

#### pea.failure(cb) *Synonym: pea.fail(cb)*

**Arguments**

 * *cb* a node style callback function whose first argument is an error

Like *pea.then* except only if the first argument to callback exists. Of course the callback also only gets the first argument.

#### pea.success(cb) *Synonym: pea.done(cb)*

**Arguments**

 * *cb* a callback function whose arguments are the non-error arguments of the result

Like *pea.then* except only if the first argument to callback is not set. It also only gets arguments 2+.

#### pea.pause()

Pauses the execution of the *Pea-Instance* unless it has already started.

    var pea = Pea(function(callback){…});
    pea.pause();

will work. While

    var pea = Pea(function(callback){…});
    setTimeout(function() { pea.pause(); }, 0);

will not.

#### pea.resume()

Resumes a paused *Pea-Instance*.

### Pea.paused(fn) or Pea.paused([ fn, … ])

**Arguments**

 * *fn* a node-style function or array of node-style funtions

Creates a paused *Pea-Instance* or array of same. To start execution you have to call *pea.resume()* on each *Pea-Instance*.

### Pea.parallel(functions)

**Arguments**

 * *functions* an array of node-style functions

Executes a set of functions in parallel. It returns an array of errors and an array of result arrays.

### Pea.serial(functions)

**Arguments**

 * *functions* an array of node-style functions

Executes a set of functions in series. If an error is returned it stops and returns that error.

### Pea.until(functions)

**Arguments**

 * *functions* an array of node-style functions

Executes a set of functions in order until there is one that does not return an error. If the last one returns an error it is the result of the entire *Pea-Instance*.

### Pea.series(functions)

**Arguments**

 * *functions* an array of node-style functions

Executes a set of functions each called with the *success* result of the previous. The additional parameters of the *Pea.series* call are passed into the first function. The result is the result of the last function. (This is like *async.waterfall*)

### Pea.map(array, iterator)

**Arguments**

 * *array* an array for each item of which *iterator* is called
 * *iterator* a node-style function whose argumens are *item*, *index*, *items*, *callback* very similar to the native *Array.map*

Executes *iterator* for each item in *array*. It returns a *Pea-Instance* whose result is the array of the mapping results passed via the callback from *iterator*.

### Pea.each(array, iterator)

**Arguments**

 * *array* an array for each item of which *iterator* is called
 * *iterator* a node-style function whose argumens are *item*, *index*, *items*, *callback* very similar to the native *Array.map*

Like *Pea.map()* except that *iterator* is called for each item in *array* in series.

### Pea.first(array, iterator)

**Arguments**

 * *array* an array for each item of which *iterator* is called
 * *iterator* a node-style function whose argumens are *item*, *index*, *items*, *callback* very similar to the native *Array.map*

Executes *iterator* until for each item in *array* until the first one that does not return an error. If all return an error, the last error is put into the *then()* callbacks *err* argument;

### Pea.all(fn, […])

**Arguments**

 * *fn* a node-style function

Executes all arguments in parallel. The returned *Pea-Instance*'s *then* callback is called with the results of the arguments in order.
